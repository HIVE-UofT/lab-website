His current work examines how large language models navigate potential risks in clinical prompts and adjust their internal reasoning toward safer responses. He enjoys thinking about AI reliability and the future of AI-supported healthcare.\nOutside of research, he loves spending time with his energetic Abyssinian cat, Lambo, who enthusiastically supervises his coding sessions."})},"/team/fang_sheng",{filePath:"pages/team/fang_sheng.mdx",timestamp:1770220869e3,pageMap:s.v,frontMatter:{title:"Fang Sheng",image:"/team/fang_sheng.jpg",role:"Research Assistant",category:"C2_40_Research Assistant",date:"2025/11/01",twitter:null,linkedin:"https://www.linkedin.com/in/fang-sheng-877281357/",google_scholar:"https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=tNWVXFQAAAAJ&hl=en",github:"https://github.com/F4NG66",website:null,orcid:"https://orcid.org/my-orcid?orcid=0009-0007-9779-5864",research_gate:null},title:"Fang Sheng"},"undefined"==typeof RemoteContent?r:RemoteContent.useTOC)}},function(e){e.O(0,[7812,7387,2888,9774,179],function(){return e(e.s=2906)}),_N_E=e.O()}]);
