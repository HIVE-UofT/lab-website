## Overview

Artificial intelligence (AI) promises to transform healthcare delivery, but its success depends as much on its users as on the algorithms. This keynote and workshop explores critical human factors that shape the adoption and effective use of AI in clinical settings. From cognitive biases and workflow integration to professional autonomy and collaboration, we will discuss why understanding human behaviour is essential for realising the potential of AI without compromising patient safety or care quality.
This workshop is funded through institutional grants from the University of Toronto and University College London. Space is limited to 40 attendees. Food and light refreshments will be provided.

## About Prof. Susanne Gaube

Dr. Susanne Gaube is a Lecturer (Assistant Professor) in Human Factors in Healthcare at UCL's Global Business School for Health (GBSH). Her research focuses on (a) identifying opportunities in healthcare that could benefit from the introduction of digital technologies, (b) understanding the support needs of healthcare providers and patients and optimal ways to implement digital health technologies, and (c) improving the interaction between users and technology with a particular focus on Radiology, Infection Prevention and Control, and Mental Health. She also investigates how AI-enabled clinical decision support systems influence decision-making and proposes strategies to enhance human-AI collaboration.
