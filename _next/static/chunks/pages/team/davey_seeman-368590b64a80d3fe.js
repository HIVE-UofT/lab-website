Davey is most interested in the fields of natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV). On one hand, Davey is fascinated by the theory behind NLP and CV architectures. But he also enjoys contemplating how these architectures can be applied to solve real-world problems in a new way. Currently, he is working at the Center for Teaching Innovation at Cornell University, where he is creating AI tools to assist professors in teaching their courses. He is also collaborating with Professor Miel Hostens to develop a CV model that determines the needs of a herd of cows using video recordings of those cows. In his time off, Davey usually browses Spotify to discover new songs. He loves showing off his song discoveries to his friends with similar music tastes."})},"/team/davey_seeman",{filePath:"pages/team/davey_seeman.mdx",timestamp:1771445158e3,pageMap:o.v,frontMatter:{title:"Davey Seeman",image:"/team/davey.png",role:"Research Assistant",category:"C3_10_Research Assistant",range:"PostHIVE: ",current_position:"Cornell University",date:"2025/08/21",linkedin:"https://www.linkedin.com/in/davey-seeman/",google_scholar:null,github:"https://github.com/Davey-Seemanz",orcid:null},title:"Davey Seeman"},"undefined"==typeof RemoteContent?r:RemoteContent.useTOC)}},function(e){e.O(0,[7812,7387,2888,9774,179],function(){return e(e.s=1900)}),_N_E=e.O()}]);
