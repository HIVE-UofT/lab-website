Minh Le is a Computer Science undergraduate at the University of Toronto. He is exploring how machine learning can enrich clinical and personal health systems, drawing on human‑computer interaction, health informatics, computer vision, and natural language processing. He believes that multimodal models can enable more holistic healthcare, and he aims to ensure these systems are both technically sound and human‑centered before they reach real‑world deployment.
