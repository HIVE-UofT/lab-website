Hemn holds an MA in Economics from the University of Ottawa, where his research examined the socioeconomic and mental health determinants of academic performance using university admissions data. His background in economics highlighted the central role of technological innovation in driving growth and productivity, which inspired him to pursue a PhD at the University of Toronto focused on AI-powered innovations in healthcare. He is particularly interested in applying advanced machine learning models to electronic health record (EHR) data to predict patient outcomes and drive more supportive, patient-centered digital care.
