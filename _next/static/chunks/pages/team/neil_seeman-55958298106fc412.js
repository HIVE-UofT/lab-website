At the University of Toronto, he teaches at the Dalla Lana School of Public Health, and is a senior fellow in the Institute of Health Policy, Management and Evaluation, The Fields Institute for Research in Mathematical Sciences, Massey College, and the Investigative Journalism Bureau. His work in the private and public sector has specialized in Big Data and inclusive data: how to hear from the voices of people traditionally left out of surveys and decision-making. He champions post-partisan approaches to solving complex public health challenges and the use of complementary datasets for public policy. Neil is a regular contributor to Nikkei Asia, The Toronto Star, and Healthcare Quarterly. He has published his research on mental health topics in Nature, Synapse, and in other leading academic journals. Neil was founder and director of the Health Strategy Innovation Cell at the University of Toronto. He is the recipient of major research grants, including a New Frontiers in Research Fund (NFRF) grant awarded through Canada’s three federal research agencies: the SSHRC, the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) and the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC). He is the co-author of three books on mental health, including “XXL: Obesity and the Limits of Shame,” which was a finalist for the Donner Book Prize and was selected as an “outstanding” title by the University Press Books Committee. He is the author, most recently, of “Accelerated Minds: Unlocking the Fascinating, Inspiring, and Often Destructive Impulses that Drive the Entrepreneurial Brain,” published in May 2023 by Sutherland House Books. Neil is a graduate of the University of Toronto Law School (JD) and the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health (MPH)."})},"/team/neil_seeman",{filePath:"pages/team/neil_seeman.mdx",timestamp:1748379182e3,pageMap:o.v,frontMatter:{title:"Neil Seeman",image:"/team/nseeman.jpg",role:"Knowledge Translation Advisor",category:"C1_20_Knowledge Translation Advisor",date:"2024/01/23",twitter:null,linkedin:"https://www.linkedin.com/in/seeman/",google_scholar:null,github:null,website:"https://riwi.com/team/neil-seeman/",orcid:null,research_gate:null},title:"Neil Seeman"},"undefined"==typeof RemoteContent?r:RemoteContent.useTOC)}},function(e){e.O(0,[812,638,888,774,179],function(){return e(e.s=6200)}),_N_E=e.O()}]);
