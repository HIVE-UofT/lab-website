Ryan Rezai is an undergraduate engineering student at the University of Waterloo. He is interested in how intelligent systems learn and in how these systems can be deployed most effectively. This has led him to research  experiences in computer vision, natural language processing, reinforcement learning, interpretability, robotics, and sensors. Because of the importance and sensitivity of healthcare, he is most attracted to health applications: models trained on medical images and/or clinical text. He sees the implementation of massive multi-modal models as inevitable, and would like to guarantee their reliability and robustness before deployment.
