Fang Sheng is an undergraduate student at the University of Toronto trained in bioinformatics and computational genomics, where he developed several predictive and generative models, including a diffusion-based antimicrobial peptide generator and a battery-survival model. 
At the HIVE Lab, his interests have shifted toward medical LLM safety. His current work examines how large language models navigate potential risks in clinical prompts and adjust their internal reasoning toward safer responses. He enjoys thinking about AI reliability and the future of AI-supported healthcare. 
Outside of research, he loves spending time with his energetic Abyssinian cat, Lambo, who enthusiastically supervises his coding sessions.
