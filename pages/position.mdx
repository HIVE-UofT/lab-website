            Join our HIVE!
          </h3>
Thank you for your interest in joining our team! We are always happy to hear from motivated students, postdocs, and researchers interested in seeing if HIVE lab might be the right place for them. Please contact `zahra.shakeri[@]utoronto.ca` for more details or read more about what we do on the <b>Project</b> page.


<b>Requirements:</b> While proficiency in all these areas is beneficial, it is not a strict requirement. We value a diverse range of experiences and skill sets, and we encourage all interested candidates to apply. We are particularly interested in candidates with a keen interest in `health informatics`, `AI`, `machine learning`, `natural language processing`, or `information visualization`. Candidates with a degree in `computer science`, `data science`, `public health`, or a related field are preferred, though it is not mandatory. We also look for candidates with `programming skills`, `excellent analytical` and `problem-solving abilities`, the capacity to work both `independently and collaboratively within a team`, strong `written` and `verbal` communication skills, a passion for `health equity`, a commitment to contributing to meaningful research, and the ability to commit to a regular, consistent schedule.

If you are interested in pursuing a postdoctoral position with our lab and meet the general requirements, we will need to collaborate on securing funding through postdoctoral scholarships, unless a funded position is announced through a special hiring call. In the absence of such a call, please consider planning for available funding opportunities. If your application is successful, we would be delighted to welcome you to our team. Ensure you are aware of both internal and external deadlines for each opportunity and communicate your plans with me at least three months prior to the deadline.
